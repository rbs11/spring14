This code distribution works releases the source code for the following replacement policies:
  (a)  RRIP   [ISCA'10]
  (b)  DIP    [ISCA'07]
  (c)  TADIP  [PACT'08]

The source files released here work in conjunction with the simulation infrastructure released
with the 1st JILP Workshop on Computer Architecture Competitions (JWAC-1):  Cache Replacement 
Competition (CRC).  Users are requested to visit http://www.jilp.org/jwac-1/ to download the 
CRC kit. Once the user has downloaded the CRC kit, the user should then copy all files found 
in this source distribution into the 'src/LLCsim/' directory of the CRC kit. Users MUST REPLACE
all existing files in the CRC kit with the contents of this distribution.

Instructions on compiling and using the kit can be found here: http://www.jilp.org/jwac-1/replacement_framework_description.html

Please consult the options.h configuration file to simulate the appropriate replacement policy.
